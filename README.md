# Data Engineering Project: Web Scraping NNGroup Articles

# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a data pipeline that scrapes article data from the Nielsen Norman Group (NNG) website using Python,    BeautifulSoup, and Requests. The pipeline extracts relevant information from multiple pages and individual article links, compiles the data, and saves it in a structured format using Pandas.

#  Objectives
1) Scrape article titles, publication dates, descriptions, links, authors, and article outlines, etc.
2) Automate the data extraction from multiple pages.
3) Build a reusable and robust scraping system.

# Tools and Libraries Used
1) requests – For sending HTTP requests to the website.
2) BeautifulSoup – For parsing HTML and extracting data.
3) pandas – For structuring and saving the scraped data.
4) time – For managing request intervals and reducing the risk of blocking.
